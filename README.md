## Exercise 17 - Fancy upload

### How to get started

Click the "Fork" button at the top of the editor to copy the exercise.

### Purpose of exercise

In many web applications we give users the ability to upload files to a server. In this exercise, you'll build a really polished input that, when a user selects a file, displays some detailed information to the user.

Your tasks:

1. display the name of the selected file

2. Display the size of the file in MB

3. display the file format

Bonus points:

1. add a button that allows you to abandon the selected file and return the component to its default state
